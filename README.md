Git repo for Contrast Security IAST/RASP hands-on lab that will help you jumpstart your DevSecOps journey. Pre-requisites: Docker and a web browser.

1. Use the Docker materials here to spin up WebGoat and onboard it to your Contrast Security instance (if you don't already have a Contrast instance, you can sign up for a free one-license Contrast Security Community Edition account at https://www.contrastsecurity.com/contrast-community-edition - follow the instructions in the https://github.com/rstatsinger/IASTRASPLab/blob/master/CESetup.pdf file)

2. Use the WebGoatLab.pdf to guide you through hands-on use cases once you have things set up.

3. Start planning how to apply DevSecOps to your own processes and culture!
