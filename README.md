Contrast Security IAST/RASP hands-on lab that will help you jumpstart your DevSecOps journey. 

Prerequisites: A Contrast Security account, Docker, and a web browser. 

Note: if you run a Windows PC, I suggest you install VirtualBox on it, create a Linux VM inside VirtualBox, install Docker on the VM, and run the Docker steps from there. If you have a Mac, just install Docker on it (if you haven't already), and you're good to go.

1. If you don't already have a Contrast account, you can sign up for a free one-license Contrast Security Community Edition (CE) account at https://www.contrastsecurity.com/contrast-community-edition. Follow the instructions in the https://github.com/rstatsinger/IASTRASPLab/blob/master/CESetup.pdf file. It will:

- lead you through Contrast CE signup
- help you onboard WebGoat into CE using Docker

2. Use the https://github.com/rstatsinger/IASTRASPLab/blob/master/WebGoatLab.pdf to guide you through hands-on use cases once you have things set up.

3. Start planning how to apply DevSecOps to your own applications, processes, and culture!
