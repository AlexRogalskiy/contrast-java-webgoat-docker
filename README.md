# Contrast Security IAST/RASP hands-on Lab

## Jumpstart your DevSecOps journey. 

## Prerequisites: A Contrast Security account, Docker, and a web browser. 

Note: if you run Windows, I suggest you install VirtualBox on it, create a Linux VM inside VirtualBox, install Docker on the VM, and run the Docker steps from there. If you have a Mac, just install Docker on it (if you haven't already), and you're good to go.

This lab should take you less than 30 minutes to get up and running. If you have trouble, definitely reach out to me!

## Setup

1. If you don't already have a Contrast account, you can sign up for a free one-license Contrast Security Community Edition (CE) account at https://www.contrastsecurity.com/contrast-community-edition. Follow the instructions in https://github.com/rstatsinger/IASTRASPLab/blob/master/CESetup.pdf. It will:

  - lead you through Contrast CE signup
  - help you onboard WebGoat into CE using Docker

2. Use https://github.com/rstatsinger/IASTRASPLab/blob/master/WebGoatLab.pdf to guide you through hands-on use cases once you have things set up.

3. Start planning how to apply DevSecOps to your own applications, processes, and culture!
