Contrast Security IAST/RASP hands-on lab that will help you jumpstart your DevSecOps journey. 
Pre-requisites: Docker and a web browser. Note: if you run a Windows PC, I suggest you install VirtualBox on it, then create a Linux VM inside VirtualBox, and run the Docker steps from there. If you have a Mac, you can just install Docker on it (if you haven't already), and be good to go.

1. Use the Docker materials here to spin up WebGoat and onboard it to your Contrast Security instance (if you don't already have a Contrast instance, you can sign up for a free one-license Contrast Security Community Edition account at https://www.contrastsecurity.com/contrast-community-edition - follow the instructions in the https://github.com/rstatsinger/IASTRASPLab/blob/master/CESetup.pdf file)

2. Use the https://github.com/rstatsinger/IASTRASPLab/blob/master/WebGoatLab.pdf to guide you through hands-on use cases once you have things set up.

3. Start planning how to apply DevSecOps to your own processes and culture!
