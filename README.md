# Security Observability: Hands-On Lab using Contrast Security's free Community Edition

## Prerequisites: A Contrast Security account, experience with Docker, and a web browser

If you don't have a Contrast Security account, you can sign up for a free one-license Community Edition (CE) account [here](https://bit.ly/341PrFu). 

## Setup

1. Follow the instructions in [CESetup.md](CESetup.md). It will:

  - lead you through Contrast CE signup if needed
  - help you onboard WebGoat into CE using Docker

2. Use [WebGoatLab.pdf](WebGoatLab.pdf) to guide you through some hands-on use cases once you have things set up.

3. Start planning how to apply DevSecOps to your own applications, processes, and culture, and increase your Security Observability!

If you have trouble - or if you don't and you just want to discuss the results - please reach out to me at robert.statsinger@contrastsecurity.com.
