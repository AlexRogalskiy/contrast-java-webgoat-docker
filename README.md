# IAST/RASP Hands-On Lab using Contrast Security's free Community Edition

## Gain hands-on experience with Application Security Monitoring and jumpstart your DevSecOps journey!

## Prerequisites: A Contrast Security account, experience with Docker, and a web browser

Note: if you run Windows, I suggest you install VirtualBox on it, create a Linux VM inside VirtualBox, install Docker on the VM, and run the Docker steps from there. 

This lab should take you less than 30 minutes to get up and running. If you have trouble, definitely reach out to me!

If you don't already have a Contrast Security account, you can sign up for a free one-license Community Edition (CE) account at https://www.contrastsecurity.com/contrast-community-edition. 

## Setup

1. Follow the instructions in https://github.com/rstatsinger/IASTRASPLab/blob/master/CESetup.pdf. It will:

  - lead you through Contrast CE signup if needed
  - help you onboard WebGoat into CE using Docker

2. Use https://github.com/rstatsinger/IASTRASPLab/blob/master/WebGoatLab.pdf to guide you through hands-on use cases once you have things set up.

3. Start planning how to apply DevSecOps to your own applications, processes, and culture!
