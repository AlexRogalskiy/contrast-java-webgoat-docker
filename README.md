# Security Observability: Hands-On Lab using Contrast Security's free Community Edition

## Prerequisites: A Contrast Security account, experience with Docker, and a web browser

This lab should take you less than 30 minutes to get up and running. If you have trouble, definitely reach out to me!

If you don't already have a Contrast Security account, you can sign up for a free one-license Community Edition (CE) account [here](https://bit.ly/341PrFu). 

## Setup

1. Follow the instructions in [CESetup.md](CESetup.md). It will:

  - lead you through Contrast CE signup if needed
  - help you onboard WebGoat into CE using Docker

2. Use https://github.com/rstatsinger/IASTRASPLab/blob/master/WebGoatLab.pdf to guide you through hands-on use cases once you have things set up.

3. Start planning how to apply DevSecOps to your own applications, processes, and culture!
